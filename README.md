# Signup Flow README

---

The project has been created as a part of Bit2Byte Bootcamp conducted by Real Dev Squad. The goal of the project is to learn and implement Test Driven Development (TDD). All the pages have been created using Test Driven Development where I wrote test suites and saw them fail and then implemented features making them pass.
